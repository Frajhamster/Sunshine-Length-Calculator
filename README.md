# Sunshine-Length-Calculator
This program calculates how long the sun shines in a specific country on earth (Based on latitude and longitude)

Main program is "power.php". You can run php files in XAMPP for example.

There is database for users missing, meaning that the last section "history" will not be working. Code for registration and login is already there.
